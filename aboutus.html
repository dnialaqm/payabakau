			<p><b>Paya Indah Wetlands</b> is a nice place to find peace and quiet and enjoy nature away from the busy city. I first visited this park (located about 15 minutes drive south-west of Putrajaya - Cyberjaya) in 2010 when it was newly established. Having gone back a few times since, most recently in March 2017, I am pleased to report that there have been a lot of improvements and the place is being reasonably well maintained, though on my last visit there were some fallen trees which had caused damage needing repair. 

This short video shows how peaceful it is here, apart from the occasional overhead airplane noise.</p></div></div>

			<p><b>Paya Indah Wetlands</b>is an ecotourism destination located near Dengkil in Kuala Langat.

Covering approximately 450 hectares, the wetlands are divided into a Conservation <em>&amp;</em> Research Zone, Educational Zone and Recreational Zone.

This massive wetlands park consists of many lakes and ponds, including a hippopotamus pond, crocodile pond, ecology pond, water lily ponds and fishing ponds.

It is also a bird-watching haven, where over 210 species of residential and migratory birds have been recorded.

The park also provides accommodation in the form of chalets, hostels and camp sites. There are also traditional Malay showhouses, where cultural activities are often held.</p></div></div>
